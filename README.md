## MIT Class of 2025 Senior Week Bidding Website

This repository contains the code for the webserver used to run the Senior Week Bidding System. 
The webserver uses the [scripts service](https://scripts.mit.edu/) to host the webserver and [XVM](xvm.mit.edu) to host the database. 
A PostgreSQL database on an autoinstall Ubuntu 18.04 ParaVM instance was used for the database.
